Write a C program for FFT.  Each element of the matrix is a 32-bit integer.  Ensure that
your program can find FT for variable input size n. 

Measure response time and CPU execution time. Consider different input sizes. What do 
you conclude from these measurements? Present your results in an appropriate form.
